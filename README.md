Programs for L2R2 model in the manuscript "Bayesian longitudinal low-rank regression models for imaging genetic data from longitudinal studies"

This L2R2 package is developed by Zhao-Hua Lu and Hongtu Zhu from the [BIG-S2 lab](http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/bigs2/). The package is also available on the [BIG-S2 GitHub site](https://github.com/BIG-S2).

To perform a joint analysis of multivariate  neuroimaging phenotypes and candidate genetic markers obtained from longitudinal  studies, we develop a Bayesian longitudinal low-rank regression (L2R2) model. The L2R2 model integrates three key methodologies: a low-rank matrix for approximating the high-dimensional regression coefficient matrices corresponding to the genetic main effects and their interactions with time, penalized splines for characterizing the overall time effect, and a sparse factor analysis model coupled with random effects for capturing within-subject spatio-temporal correlations of longitudinal phenotypes. Posterior computation proceeds via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

Please down load the zip file and install locally at this moment. Package may become available in CRAN later.

L2R2 is a function for estimating L2R2 model with MCMC algorithm. Please refer to the example in help page.

The MCMC output are store in the list "Output", which contains the MCMC samples, posterior mean and SE of the parameters.

The package is based on the c code generated by Matlab Coder. In addition, R and C wrapper functions are developed for the package.
